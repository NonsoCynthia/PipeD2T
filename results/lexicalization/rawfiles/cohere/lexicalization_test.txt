The Apollo program was a series of manned lunar landing missions, which included Apollo 17, launched into space in December 1972. The Apollo 17 spacecraft was a Command Module named "America" and a Lunar Module called "Challenger". The Challenger module had a launch mass of just over 16,000 kilograms and was the sixth and final lunar module to be flown into space. The crew of Apollo 17 consisted of Commander Eugene Cernan and Harrison Schmitt, who was a scientist-astronaut. The mission lasted 12 days, which included 3 days and 14 hours on the lunar surface. The service module was equipped with a heat flow experiment package to monitor the lunar module's heat during the mission. The results from this experiment were used to validate thermal models of the lunar module.  The Apollo 17 lunar module landed in the Taurus–Littrow valley on the Moon's surface, which was located in the upland region on the eastern rim of the Mare Serenitatis basin. The landing site was located about 7.5 kilometers northwest of the crater Littrow, which was a prominent landmark. The crew of Apollo 17 spent just over 22 hours on the lunar surface, during which they collected almost 94 kilograms of lunar material to bring back to Earth. The Apollo 17 mission returned to Earth on 19 December 1972, with a splashdown in the Pacific Ocean near the Hawaiian island of Hawaii.  The service module of the Apollo 17 spacecraft was used to perform a heat flow experiment that involved drilling into the lunar surface and measuring the temperature within the lunar regolith. The results of this experiment were useful in understanding the thermal properties of the Moon's surface and the effects of the lunar environment on spacecraft. The data from the experiment was also used to validate thermal models of the lunar surface, which were used to predict the behavior of the lunar environment and to design future lunar missions.

The Apollo-Soyuz Test Project was a joint space flight between the Soviet Union and the United States, where the two countries sent astronauts and cosmonauts to test the possibility of an emergency docking between spacecraft. The project resulted in the first-ever international crewed space flight, and paved the way for future cooperation between the two nations in space exploration.   The spacecraft involved in the test were the Apollo command module, which was designed and built by NASA, and the Soyuz 7K-TM spacecraft, which was designed and built by the Soviet Union. The two spacecraft were launched separately, with the Apollo spacecraft launching from the Kennedy Space Center in Florida, and the Soyuz spacecraft launching from the Baikonur Cosmodrome in the Kazakh Soviet Socialist Republic.   The two spacecraft were successfully docked together in orbit, and the astronauts and cosmonauts conducted a series of tests and experiments, including a joint meal and a press conference. The mission was considered a success, and marked the beginning of a new era of international cooperation in space exploration.   The project's impact was felt around the world, and was seen as a significant step towards easing tensions between the Soviet Union and the United States, which had been locked in a Cold War for several years. The successful mission also helped to boost the space programs of both countries, and led to further cooperation in the form of the Apollo-Soyuz Test Project.
