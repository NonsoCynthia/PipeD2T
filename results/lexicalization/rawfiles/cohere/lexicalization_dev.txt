The lexicalized output for the query is:  ENTITY-1: *Alcatraz Versus the Evil Librarians* is a book written in English, a language spoken in Great Britain. It is from the United States, where *Barack Obama* is the leader and *African Americans* are an ethnic group.
The lexicalized output for the given query is:  ENTITY-1: VP [aspect=simple, tense=present, voice=active, person=3rd, number=null] be located in/at ENTITY-2 Washington, D.C. (a city where the African Americans are an ethnic group)  Alternatively, the following output is also acceptable:   ENTITY-1: VP [aspect=simple, tense=present, voice=active, person=3rd, number=null] be located in/at ENTITY-2 Washington, D.C. (a place that is the capital of the United States where English is spoken and African Americans are an ethnic group)  The reasoning behind the output is the following:  The first triple states that A Severed Wasp is from the United States.  The second triple mentions that English is spoken in Great Britain. However, the information about the language of the United States is not relevant to the output as it is not explicitly mentioned in the other triples. The capital of the United States is Washington, D.C., as stated in the third triple. The fourth triple then adds more detail about the ethnic groups in the United States, specifying that African Americans are one such group.   With this information, the output is generated to reflect that A Severed Wasp is from the United States, where English is spoken and African Americans are an ethnic group. The specific tense, aspect, and voice of the VP are chosen to best reflect the information provided.

However, without further context or a specific language model, I'm limited in my ability to directly generate text that matches the examples' format and complexity.  To generate text in a specific format or style, it's essential to have a clear understanding of the desired output structure, language rules, and the context in which the text will be used. If you have access to a dataset or language model that can guide the text generation process, I would be happy to work with that to produce the desired output.
